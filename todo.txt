Installation:

sudo easy_install pyzmq
sudo easy_install trueskill
python dice.py


Pain:

have to make a new socket when zmq.IDENTITY changes. this was confusing
notification for "game over because somebody ran out of time" is pretty mysterious
unclear who has next action after round ends


client todo:
bot registration is clunky (each name only plays 1 game)
